# Active Directory & Attack Detection Lab

## Objective

This project involves simulating real world threats through the use of Splunk SIEM to ingest data from the Windows Domain Controller and a Windows Target Machine. I then used Kali Linux to perform a Brute Force Attack to see if Splunk was able to display the events of an attempted logon.s.

### Skills Learned

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
